# Tribute Page for the actor Philip Seymour Hoffmann 

Very basic site built using HTML and CSS. Wanted a practise project to get back into Web Development and just rewatched Boogie Nights. so I made the site in memory of PSH. 

#### Things I can improve on 
- I should have made the timeline section into a table, the dates currently do not line up with the top of the information
- Need to improve on design. It looks very basic and empty
